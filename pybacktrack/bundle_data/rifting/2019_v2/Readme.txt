The rift start/end time 5 minute grids were generated with 'misc/generate_rift_grids.py' using the Muller et al. (2019)
deforming model to find when deformation started and ended at grid locations that have undergone extensional deformation
and where total sediment thickness has been recorded (in continent crustal regions).
